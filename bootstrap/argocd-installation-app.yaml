# THIS FILE IS DEPRECATED
# The ArgoCD installation is now managed directly via kustomization
# See argocd-install/ directory for the current configuration
#
# The new architecture uses:
# - argocd-install/kustomization.yaml (ArgoCD installation)
# - bootstrap/bootstrap-apps.yaml (App of Apps root)
# - bootstrap/core/ (Core component applications)
